Advantages of an Array in C/C++: 

Random access of elements using array index.
Use of fewer line of code as it creates a single array of multiple elements.
Easy access to all the elements.
Traversal through the array becomes easy using a single loop.
Sorting becomes easy as it can be accomplished by writing fewer line of code.


Disadvantages of an Array in C/C++: 

Allows a fixed number of elements to be entered which is decided at the time of declaration. Unlike a linked list, an array in C is not dynamic.
Insertion and deletion of elements can be costly since the elements are needed to be managed in accordance with the new memory allocation.
